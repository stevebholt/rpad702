    "text": "This course explores the complex interplay between democracy, politics, and administration in the United States. Our aim is to begin developing an understanding of the contemporary role public organizations play in the political process and broader democratic context. To this end, we will examine the major intellectual and constitutional origins and subsequent evolution of American government and public administration. We will also explore various theories that (1) inform our understanding of the roles and responsibilities of modern public organizations and administrators, and (2) explain current governance arrangements."

    "text": "👨‍🏫: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\n📅: Tuesdays, 4:30 pm - 8:10 pm, Husted 013\n📧: sbholt@albany.edu\n🏫: Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n☎️: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThis course explores the complex interplay between democracy, politics, and administration in the United States. Our aim is to begin developing an understanding of the contemporary role public organizations play in the political process and broader democratic context. To this end, we will examine the major intellectual and constitutional origins and subsequent evolution of American government and public administration. We will also explore various theories that (1) inform our understanding of the roles and responsibilities of modern public organizations and administrators, and (2) explain current governance arrangements.\nBy the end of this course, students should have:\n\nGained a basic understanding of the central debates surrounding the legal, political, and civil/social dimensions of U.S. public administration,\nAcquired the knowledge necessary to think critically about the role of U.S. public administration in the political process and contemporary society, and\nLearned how to apply various theoretical lenses when tackling political-administrative issues.\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the course, students will be expected to read several books. You can find the complete list of required and recommended books here. The rest will be shared by Zotero.\n\n\n\nZotero - Zotero is a free platform for organizing and sharing academic work and it is how readings will be distributed to the class. You can download the app here. I suggest also downloading the browser connector for whatever browser you use - it helps save a dramatic amount of time when conducting a literature review. During the first week of classes you will receive an invitation to join the class Zotero library. If you do not receive one, please email the professor. I provide an introduction to Zotero and the features most applicable to this class in the embedded video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of citation organizer software options out there for researchers to use and, having experimented with most of them, Zotero is by far the best. It is free; Open Source; designed and developed by researchers; and governed as a non-profit to protect the integrity and accessibility of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Zotero\n\n\n\nWhen you receive an announcement that the group invitations for the class library have been sent, go to the Zotero.org website, login to your account, and click the groups tab. You should see RPAD 500 with a red button that says join. Click join. In the Zotero app, click the green refresh circle in the top right and the class library should appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nFinal Paper (70% of final grade)\nPaper proposal (15% of final grade)\nDiscussion leader (10% of final grade)\nParticipation (5% of final grade)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents will be required to prepare a publication quality manuscript in one of two stages: 1) a full manuscript with analysis (for students who have necessary methodological training) or 2) a research proposal.\nA full manuscript should follow the format of an academic journal article: introduction, background and theory, hypotheses to be examined, data and methods used to test the hypotheses, discussion of results, and conclusion. For students who lack the methodological preparation to complete the analysis, a research proposal will be substituted for a full manuscript draft. The format should be the same; however, students will instead describe the research design and data they would use to test the theoretical propositions made in their research proposal, the methods they would use to analyze the data, and articulate how and why such research would contribute to the literature of their chosen proposal topic. Research proposals should use either extant data, originally collected administrative or survey data, or mixed methods that incorporate focus groups, interviews, etc. alongside survey or administrative data.\nPre-writing tasks. To ensure students are on track, students are required to submit a two-page summary of their proposed paper by October 11th at midnight via Brightspace. The summary should include: a clear summary of the theories used to form hypotheses in the paper, the research questions the paper seeks to answer, a clear summary of the data and research design that will be used, and a preliminary list of the literature that will inform the paper. I will not accept late submissions of summaries. I will return summaries with feedback within 7 days after submission.\nFormatting. There is no length requirement, but papers should be 20-30 pages excluding tables, figures, and references. Students should use APA formatting for their citations.\nSubmission of papers. The first draft of the final paper will be submitted on November 14th by midnight through Brightspace. Note that this is two weeks before the final class. Each student will review two of their classmates’ papers and draft a referee report, due to the author and via Blackboard by midnight on November 23rd. Students will then 1) edit their paper in response to the referee reports, and 2) prepare a response document that describes how their revisions address each reviewer comment or, if no edit was made, explains why. Both the response document and revised final paper will be due by Midnight December 9th on Blackboard.\nLate assignments. Late work will not be accepted and students who turn in work late will receive no credit.\n\n\n\nEach week, students will be assigned a reading to summarize and lead the class discussion concerning that reading. When leading discussion for a reading, students should prepare one-page, single-spaced summaries of the reading, verbally summarize the reading in class, identify points the student found interesting, and identify potential issues, limitations, or gaps in the ideas presented in the readings. The summaries are to be emailed to the professor the day before class. The professor will post the summaries to Blackboard to facilitate notes sharing across the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf all students take good, useful notes, this will be a highly valuable resource for recalling, retaining, and studying the core ideas and concepts covered in the class.\n\n\n\n\n\nA big part of learning comes from class discussion and participation in class activities. You can do neither if you do not attend class. Attendance will be tracked and points will be subtracted for absences not cleared with me ahead of time. In addition to attendance, sustained and regular contributions to class discussion will be factored into the class participation grade for the semester. Note that while participation only affects 5% of your final grade, it can mean a difference of a full letter in the grade you receive. In education, as with most things in life, what you get out of an act is a function of what you put into that act. Consider this my small way of nudging you towards getting all you can out of this class.\n\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n👨‍🏫:\nLecture\n\n\n📅:\nPaper Assignment Deadline\n\n\n📖:\nReading is from required text (by author last name)\n\n\n📄:\nReading is from an article/chapter on Zotero (by author last name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTopic\nAssignments\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n8/22\nIntro to course\n\n\n\n\n8/29\nTheory and Craft in Public Administration\n\n📄 Whetten  📄 Sutton and Staw  📄 Merton  📄 Bozeman  📄 Dubnick  📄 Kelman et al.  📄 Davis and Stazyk  📄 Denhardt\n\n\n9/5\nThe Study of Politics and Administration\n\n📖 Sandel  📖 Dewey  📖 Durant  📖 Goodnow  📖 March and Olsen (1989)  📄 Wilson  📄 Friedrich  📄 Finer  📄 Long\n\n\n9/12\nThe Constitutional Basis of Public Administration, Part I\n\n📖 Skowronek  📖 Rohr  📖 Bartelli and Lynn  📖 Peterson  📖 Resh  📖 Feeley and Rubin\n\n\n9/19\nThe Constitutional Basis of Public Administration, Part II\n\n📄 Rosenbloom  📄 O’Toole  📄 Heady  📄 Green  📄 Moe and Gilmour  📄 Wise and O’Leary  📄 Catlaw\n\n\n9/26\nDemocracy and Public Administration\n\n📖 Redford  📖 Yates  📖 Putnam  📖 Borins  📄 Waldo  📄 Golembiewski &lt; br/&gt; 📄 Kirlin  📄 Denhardt & Denhardt (2000)\n\n\n10/3\nOrganized Interests and the Political Economy\n\n📖 Downs  📖 Olson  📖 Niskanen  📖 Lowi  📖 Moe (1980)  📖 Rourke  📖 Einstein, Glick, & Palmer\n\n\n10/10\nFall Break\n\n\n\n\n10/17\nPublic Organizations: Role, Responsibility, and Power, Part I\n\n📖 West  📖 Ostrom  📖 Goodsell  📄 Moe (1989)\n\n\n10/24\nPublic Organizations: Role, Responsibility, and Power, Part II\n\n📖 Aberbach & Rockman  📖 Brehm & Gates  📖 Carpenter  📖 Peters  📖 Herd & Moynihan\n\n\n10/31\nPolitical Control of the Bureaucracy\n\n📄 McCubbins, Noll, & Weingast (1987)  📄 Calvert, McCubbins, & Weingast (1989)  📄 Wood & Cook  📄 Banks & Weingast  📄 Moe (1995)  📄 Waterman, Rouse, & Wright  📄 Balla  📄 Huber, Shipman, & Pfahler  📄 Moe (2006)\n\n\n11/7\nThe “Public” in Public Administration\n\n📖 Kettle  📖 Meier & O’Toole  📄 Appleby  📄 Mintzberg  📄 Box et al.  📄 Adams  📄 Bingham, Nabatchi, & O’ Leary  📄 Boyte  📄 Berry  📄 Bradbury & Kellough\n\n\n11/14\nWhat is Public?

Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from the text, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 10% of your grade, and you can’t participate if you’re not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Brightspace. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Brightspace as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university’s academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university’s academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students.

    "text": "This course explores the complex interplay between democracy, politics, and administration in the United States. Our aim is to begin developing an understanding of the contemporary role public organizations play in the political process and broader democratic context. To this end, we will examine the major intellectual and constitutional origins and subsequent evolution of American government and public administration. We will also explore various theories that (1) inform our understanding of the roles and responsibilities of modern public organizations and administrators, and (2) explain current governance arrangements.\nBy the end of this course, students should have:\n\nGained a basic understanding of the central debates surrounding the legal, political, and civil/social dimensions of U.S. public administration,\nAcquired the knowledge necessary to think critically about the role of U.S. public administration in the political process and contemporary society, and\nLearned how to apply various theoretical lenses when tackling political-administrative issues."

    "text": "The following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nFinal Paper (70% of final grade)\nPaper proposal (15% of final grade)\nDiscussion leader (10% of final grade)\nParticipation (5% of final grade)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents will be required to prepare a publication quality manuscript in one of two stages: 1) a full manuscript with analysis (for students who have necessary methodological training) or 2) a research proposal.\nA full manuscript should follow the format of an academic journal article: introduction, background and theory, hypotheses to be examined, data and methods used to test the hypotheses, discussion of results, and conclusion. For students who lack the methodological preparation to complete the analysis, a research proposal will be substituted for a full manuscript draft. The format should be the same; however, students will instead describe the research design and data they would use to test the theoretical propositions made in their research proposal, the methods they would use to analyze the data, and articulate how and why such research would contribute to the literature of their chosen proposal topic. Research proposals should use either extant data, originally collected administrative or survey data, or mixed methods that incorporate focus groups, interviews, etc. alongside survey or administrative data.\nPre-writing tasks. To ensure students are on track, students are required to submit a two-page summary of their proposed paper by October 11th at midnight via Brightspace. The summary should include: a clear summary of the theories used to form hypotheses in the paper, the research questions the paper seeks to answer, a clear summary of the data and research design that will be used, and a preliminary list of the literature that will inform the paper. I will not accept late submissions of summaries. I will return summaries with feedback within 7 days after submission.\nFormatting. There is no length requirement, but papers should be 20-30 pages excluding tables, figures, and references. Students should use APA formatting for their citations.\nSubmission of papers. The first draft of the final paper will be submitted on November 14th by midnight through Brightspace. Note that this is two weeks before the final class. Each student will review two of their classmates’ papers and draft a referee report, due to the author and via Blackboard by midnight on November 23rd. Students will then 1) edit their paper in response to the referee reports, and 2) prepare a response document that describes how their revisions address each reviewer comment or, if no edit was made, explains why. Both the response document and revised final paper will be due by Midnight December 9th on Blackboard.\nLate assignments. Late work will not be accepted and students who turn in work late will receive no credit.\n\n\n\nEach week, students will be assigned a reading to summarize and lead the class discussion concerning that reading. When leading discussion for a reading, students should prepare one-page, single-spaced summaries of the reading, verbally summarize the reading in class, identify points the student found interesting, and identify potential issues, limitations, or gaps in the ideas presented in the readings. The summaries are to be emailed to the professor the day before class. The professor will post the summaries to Blackboard to facilitate notes sharing across the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf all students take good, useful notes, this will be a highly valuable resource for recalling, retaining, and studying the core ideas and concepts covered in the class.\n\n\n\n\n\nA big part of learning comes from class discussion and participation in class activities. You can do neither if you do not attend class. Attendance will be tracked and points will be subtracted for absences not cleared with me ahead of time. In addition to attendance, sustained and regular contributions to class discussion will be factored into the class participation grade for the semester. Note that while participation only affects 5% of your final grade, it can mean a difference of a full letter in the grade you receive. In education, as with most things in life, what you get out of an act is a function of what you put into that act. Consider this my small way of nudging you towards getting all you can out of this class."

    "text": "Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from the text, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 10% of your grade, and you can’t participate if you’re not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Brightspace. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Brightspace as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable. Grade Scale Used for Calculating Class Grades\n\n\n\nPercent\nGrade\nPoints\n\n\n\n\n93-100\nA\n4.0\n\n\n90-92\nA-\n3.7\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n3.3\n\n\n83-86\nB\n3.0\n\n\n80-82\nB-\n2.7\n\n\n77-79\nC+\n2.3\n\n\n73-76\nC\n2.0\n\n\n70-72\nC-\n1.7\n\n\n67-69\nD+\n1.3\n\n\n63-66\nD\n1.0\n\n\n60-62\nD-\n0.7\n\n\n&lt; 60\nF\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe percent refers to the percent of available weighted points earned. Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university’s academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university’s academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501.
